"description": "Today's robots are nothing short of astonishing. Those coming in the not-too-distant future are simply revolutionary—and they are becoming eerily like us. What does it take to make a humanoid robot—a robot that can do anything we can do without the benefit of a human brain? How close are scientists to replicating some of the particularly challenging human characteristics? (Think fingers and toes.) Why are we even attempting to create humanoids in the first place? ROBOTS answers these questions and more as it showcases the latest developments—the successes and failures—of robotics around the world. ROBOTS is a fascinating and fun look at what makes us human, how far machines can really go to look and act like us, and how humanoids are already changing our world. ROBOTS is a sneak peek into the future at what might be possible as scientists use innovative engineering and design to make cyber characters less 'humanoid' and more just plain human.

Through brilliant narration by film and television icon Sir Patrick Stewart and extensive interviews with NASA astronauts Chris Ferguson and Serena Aunon, the film captures the spirit of human exploration and depicts how NASA has transitioned from the end of the space shuttle era to a much more ambitious future that will forever change how we live and operate in space. Meet the new machines and craft that will help NASA write this new chapter in space exploration. Take a look back at the space shuttle program and its 135 missions flown by 355 astronauts. Learn how the shuttle program's last major project—the launch and assembly of the International Space Station—will now help to reveal the challenges that may face our deep space explorers on their way toward new frontiers.",
